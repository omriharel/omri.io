And a blog. That's wonderful! Almost as wonderful as poros! ..Okay, I might be a *little* bit off. But it's still pretty nice.\n\nSo now, equipped with my very own [*.io*](http://omri.io) domain name, and an extreme thirst for angryface pun-haters, I embark on a fresh journey of having *absolutely no fucking idea* what I am doing. With lots and lots of [Docker](http://docker.io), as I hear that is quite popular nowadays.\n\n##### Architecture\n\nSetting this stack up was relatively simple, especially for a complete web-moron such as myself. This blog runs on [Ghost](http://ghost.org), an open-source blogging platform running on NodeJS. It's hosted on a [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) Ubuntu server, and runs on top of Docker containers (one per service, so one for this blog and another one with nginx for the main area, currently).\n\nIn addition to that, a main nginx server runs directly on top of the server, and it acts as the gateway to everything. It reverse-proxies requests by their subdomain to their appropriate Docker container's port:\n\n```\nmain_nginx\n    ------> omri.io, www.omri.io -> http://localhost:6000\n    ------> blog.omri.io -> http://localhost:6001\n```\n\nIn order to keep the docker containers volatile and non-important, their relevant data directories are volumes originating from the server's filesystem.\n\nKeep in mind: doing this isn't enough on its own and you'll also need to create A-records in your domain's DNS settings, for every subdomain that you wish to reach your server.\n\nShould I decide to write any real code and *actually* do something with this virtual space, it'll be made available in my [GitHub repository](http://github.com/omriharel/omri.io) that I opened for this project.\n\n##### Conclusion\n\nBut for now, hello there! And thanks for checking me out, blogboys. I, for one, am excited and also a bit disappointed that we made it so far without any puns.

It has to do with the way memory allocation happens when you `range` over an array of structs in golang.\n\nSay you have a Deer struct:\n\n```\ntype Deer struct {\n    Hooves []Hoof\n}\n```\n\nDeer have four hooves, so the above representation seems faithful in terms of memory allocation - hooves belong in the deer, they're a part of it.\n\nNow let's consider the case where we'd like to determine whether the deer is currently hopping. We define a hop as any point in time where the deer has two or more hooves in the air.\n\nFor the sake of my example, instead of simply counting how many hooves are mid-air, I will want to do more things with those hooves later, so I want to take that subset into a separate array. Since memory has already been allocated previously for the Hooves (when the Deer was adorably constructed), I would prefer to not allocate it again, meaning I will use an array of Hoof pointers: `[]*Hoof`\n\nHere's what this code would look like:\n```\nfunc (deer *Deer) GetMidAirHooves() []*Hoof {\n    midAirHooves := []*Hoof{}\n\n    for _, hoof := range deer.Hooves {\n        if hoof.MidAir() {\n\n            // append the hoof's address\n            midAirHooves = append(midAirHooves, &hoof)\n        }\n    }\n\n    return midAirHooves\n}\n```\n\nThis is where it may get confusing: when you `range` over an array of structs, and then reference the current struct's address (`&hoof` in our example), you're referencing the _address of the memory allocated for the iteration itself_. This memory has the iterated structs copied into it one after the other, and once the iteration ends, any reference to it will only give you the *last* struct in the array. The de-facto result is that `midAirHooves` will contain as many pointers as there are hooves in the air, all of them pointing to the fourth hoof.\n\nThe implications is that if you still want to produce a pointer array from a struct array, you'll need to use the index to correctly point to the struct. In our case the loop would look as such:\n```\n    for i, hoof := range deer.Hooves {\n        if hoof.MidAir() {\n\n            // append the real hoof's address\n            midAirHooves = append(midAirHooves, &(deer.Hooves[i]))\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nWatch out for this tricky behavior when writing your code!","html":"<p>I want to write about an unintuitive phenomenon I encountered today while debugging my code.
